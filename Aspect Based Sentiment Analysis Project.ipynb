    "## Introduction\n",
    "Aspect based sentiment analysis, can be viewed as two separate problems; Mining the appropriate aspects which are being either explicitly or implicitly mentioned within the text, and finding the polarity of sentiment allocated to each aspect found within. Both of these steps pose major difficulties as aspect identification (topic modeling) can be extremely difficult. One of the issues I noticed while performing my aspect mining process was that the labels assigned by the human labeler can be inconsistent and in cases fairly arbitrary. For instance there is a selective amount of ambiguity regarding what an aspect of the review might be e.g. *'I just got an older 866 Mhz system with 512 PC 133 RAM and it also runs fine on that.'* is a sentence from a review on Norton from the given data set - the labeled aspect is memory usage, my first approach at aspect labeling was to use an apriory algorithm approach which got system as the aspect and my second approach a LDA sampling of the data returned run as the aspect. While neither are as exact as the original label it is hard to argue that they aren't also aspects related to the sentiment of the review i.e. system performance and how well the program runs. This is also a product of the labeling criteria the dataset took. In my opinion the aspect labeling could have been stricter regarding the number of categories. An additional layer of difficulty of this problem is that the number of aspects labeled to each sentence can be greater than one. Within my experimentation on this problem I don't focus on this as a major component rather compare the overlap between the given and my generated labels. Experimenting within this project I decided to try both the approach of keeping the aspect identification and the sentiment analysis separate and also having a technique whereby the are joined and sentiment can theoretically be different between aspects occupying the same sentence."

    "The First step of the preprocessing of the data is reading all of the files within each of the three review sub categories into a dictionary. Initially I was having encoding issues so I experimented with a number of different options until finding that using the encoding ISO-8859-1 allowed me to import all of the files without issue. The text is then subsiquently stored in a dictionary with the product name mined from the title of the text document."

       " '\\n##*****DO NOT BUY THIS PHONE***** ****READ WHY****\\n##In October of 2003, I bought a Nokia 3650 off of eBay.\\n##It was an OK phone with a really nice screen, great battery life, decent signal, and cool applications.\\n##It was a major step up from a Sony t68i.\\n##The 3650--being essentially a mini-computer--had memory leaks and occassional crashing, but nothing that a quick power cycle couldn\\'t help.\\n##Most importantly, it allowed me to get on the Internet via Bluetooth via GPRS flawlessly.\\n##It\\'s a nice phone, and I\\'m glad to have used it.\\n##In July of 2004, I purchased a Nokia 6600 from T-Mobile.\\n##Since I use my Palm PDA and T-Mobile offers unlimited Internet, I asked the sales representative if I could use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for my Palm, and he said yes.\\n##So I bought the phone and went on my merry way.\\nBLUETOOTH[-3]##BLUETOOTH DOES NOT WORK ON THIS PHONE.\\n##THE ADVERTISING IS A LIE.\\nBluetooth[-3]##Though nearly a dozen different people at both T-Mobile and Nokia have told me otherwise, it is simply not possible to use this phone as a Bluetooth modem for the vast majority of PDAs and many other devices.\\n##While the two devices will pair, the phone will immediately drop the connection if any data is transferred.\\n##With the recent \"bluejacking\" vunerability, the Bluetooth overseers have created a new security system called Combination Key.\\n##This helps prevent people from sending short \"obscene\" messages to your phone.\\n##The older security method is called Unit Key.\\n##Most Bluetooth devices only support the older security system, Unit Key.\\n##This includes ALL Palm PDAs! Further, due to an unparalled design oversight, Nokia is the only device that supports Combination Key that is NOT BACKWARDS COMPATIBLE with the older devices that people actually own.\\n##Does all this sound technical?\\n##That\\'s because it is, and the only way I learned it was by spending over an hour talking to T-Mobile\\'s tier-3 technicians in South Africa (to learn that the problem wasn\\'t about T-Mobile) and three hours of getting nowhere with Nokia support technicians reading endlessly from scripts, never deviating, until I started cursing and got a tier-2 tech.\\nPHONE[-3]##Only then did I learn the truth -- THIS PHONE DOES NOT WORK WITH PALM PDAS!\\n##So, after all this frustration of adding all of my newest contacts to the 6600, I asked the technician if it were possible to transfer the data from the 6600 to the 3650.\\n##He advised me to back up the 6600 to a newly formatted Nokia MMC card, and restore the data to the 3650.\\n##I followed the technician\\'s directions to the letter while they were on the phone, and after I had done so, the phone restarted and displayed the message \"Phone startup failed. Contact the retailer.\"\\n##I spent over an hour talking to a tier-2 technician who told me that their tier-1 technician should have known that it was not possible to backup the 6600 to the 3650 safely in any condition.\\n##I could not get the 3650 working to even factory defaults, even after trying every reset code they could muster.\\n##Nokia finally determined that my phone was in need of repair, but since it was out of warranty (it was made in May \\'03 and they would not take an eBay purchase as proof) they refused to fix the phone for less than $120!\\n##After over two hours of being placed on hold and persuasion, a supervisor finally agreed to fix the phone for free.\\n##I did a little research and discovered that the repair could be done by any basic cell-phone for $30.\\n##All that had to be done was restore the software to the phone, and all that took was a cable and some Nokia software.\\n##I still decided to send in the phone, since insured shipping was only $10.\\n##Two weeks later I mailed the phone in for repair.\\n##Two days after they received the phone, I received a letter in my mailbox stating that if I did not pay $120 for the repair of my phone, it would be returned unrepaired.\\n##I called Nokia to try to get it sorted out, and they stated that they had no recollection of ever promising to repair the phone for free.\\n##They stated that though it was a simple repair they would not do it for less than $120.\\n##I suggested that it didn\\'t make sense for me to send in the phone for repair if I thought Nokia would charge me $120 to repair it since I could get it done locally for $30.\\nnokia[-3]##This simple nuance was too much for Nokia, and they still refuse to acknoledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free.\\n##The supervisor stated that it must have been third-party applications on the 6600 that caused the 3650 to break, and would not take the suggestion that his own tier-2 technicians stated that it was not possible to back up the 6600 to the 3650 without damaging the 3650, regardless of what was or was not on the 6600.\\nNokia[-3]##In short - Nokia themselves don\\'t know that this phone doesn\\'t work with the Palm, and if you don\\'t heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts, chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly.\\n##You will also hard-reset both your Palm and your Nokia to factory defaults in their lame attempts to get the script to work, though it will not.\\nNokia[-3]##Ultimately you will learn just how bad Nokia is, and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved.\\n',\n",

    "It is an industry standard in machine learning to split our data into feature and label data in such a way that we can use the data more effectively i.e. training and testing for a supervied learning algorithm and  evaluate our algorithms perform the tasks more generally.<br>\n",
    "Here I use regular expressions to split on either '##' or '\\n'. Labels denotining the aspect and the sentiment polarity will be conained within of the form '*\\<aspect\\>\\[+/-x\\]*' where x is a numerical value categorising the percieved strength of the sentiment. If there is no label for the sentence I substitute in a 'neutral' evaluation to replace it.\n",
    "I decided to use the map function to apply the function to my container of reviews instead of passing the original container to the function to reduce the complexity of writing. However I think that the required additional reformating requiring unpacking and rezipping the contents harms the legibilility of the code, so don't continue this practice throught the project."

    "In this function I split the label into a tuple of the two category types - aspect and sentiment. This is already an addmition that the approach I will use is to try and split the problem into two seperate parts of aspect identication and the subsiquent sentiment analysis. An alternative approach could have been to perform supervised learning on the entire original label keeping aspect+ and aspect- as sperate categories. However I belive this would have issues due to the dilution of the number of examples, so would only be appropiate tactic for extreamly large datasets.<br>\n",
    "Again, here I use regular expressions to perform additional restructuring and deduce the number of aspect, sentiment pairs based on the length of the string once all non +/- have been removed. I process the labels differently if it is a single aspect and sentiment, or multi class. I replace + and - for pos and neg respectively and for review sentences which don't have a label currently I substitute in ('general', 'neu').\n"

    "example of each of these e.g.\n",
    "- ringtones vs. ringtone\n",
    "- battery vs. battery life\n",
    "\n",
    "Benefits of using fuzzy comparison instead of stemming or lemmatization for dimentionality reduction here are that we catch aspect names whic have been miss spelt or every comprise of two words.<br>\n",
    "This fuzzy comparison algorithm uses Levenshtein distance (edit distance) (seatgeek/thefuzz: Fuzzy String Matching in Python, n.d.) which computes a cost based on the number of single character changes required to turn one string into the other. Meaning the number of the algorithm has to change a letter increases the cost by 1. A ratio of similarity can then be computed by calculating the cost normalised reletive to the lengths of the strings involved. Fuzzy comparison was used by Hu and Lui for dimentionality reduction during frequent features generation and opinion word extraction stage of their paper 'Mining Opinion Features in Customer Reviews' (2004)."

    "Through this I was able to reduce the count of the number of aspects down from 166 to 139, which equates to a **13.2% decrease**. This isn't a major dimentionality decrease but since the overall size of the data is quite small. For training a supervised model this reduction of noise in the labels could have a major effect on the overall performance of the algorithm, techniques such as these are very commonly applied to multi-label classification problems (Siblini, Kuntz and Meyer, 2021)."

    "## Systems level algorithm Stratergy Aspect Based Sentiment Analysis\n",
    "For my initial stratergy I chose to take a similar approach to the following figure:\n",
    "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align: center;\"> Figure 1: Hu and Li's summerization of Aspect based opinion mining techniques (2004)</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Modified Approach\n",
    "- Step 1. Cleaning the sentence data for feature extraction, removal of punctuation, stop word and other information which make the sentences harder to parse. Including this as a column of my dataframe called Filtered Sentences <br>\n",
    "- Step 2. Performing POS tagging on these Filtered Sentences - new column 'Tagged Sentences' <br>\n",
    "- Step 3. Perform Noun chunking on sentences using spacy<br>\n",
    "- Step 4. Get all linear (word by word) 3 word sub strings from these chunks append to a list of transactions for each sentence<br>\n",
    "- Step 5. Pass transactions to TransactionEncoder() forms using  one-hot encoding a boolean matrix on whether or not a transaction occurs in that sentence.<br>\n",
    "- Step 6. Pass this one-hot transaction occurance matrix to the apriori algorithm, which returns all transactions which meet the given support threshhold in our case 0.01.<br>\n",
    "- Step 7. Remove cooccuring transactions e.i. only return transactions with list length 1<br>\n",
    "- Step 8. Remove nonsense results all non Noun types and with lenth less than than 3. Keep only string noun phrases as extracted feautres<br>\n",
    "- Step 9. Parse monogram, bigram, and trigram versions of the filtered sentences if noun phrase matches one of the extracted features append to list of mined aspects for that review<br>\n",
    "- Step 10. Opinion word extraction find the neighboring adjectives within tagged sentences capture the name and index as well as the index of the mined aspects\n",
    "- Step 11. Use a VADER sentiment analysis tool from the nltk library to find the compound polarity of the adjective, multiply this by $\\frac{1}{x}$ were x is the distance between the mined aspect and the adjective i.e. the absolute difference in index. This is summed for all neighboring adjectives\n",
    "- Step 12. sentiment is then classified - positive > 0, neutral = 0, negative < 0.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Reasoning and Explaination\n",
    "##### Spacy\n",
    "Spacy provides a convinient, yet relitively commpute intensive method to perform PoS and Noun chunking. It does so using increasingly large CNNs which are pre-trained on a large variety of labbled data. <br>\n",
    "Using this method I only capture words which my tagger thinks could be nouns.\n",
    "##### Only Explict Aspects\n",
    "A weakness of this approach is I only get aspect which are explicitly mentioned within my review sentence. and never aspects which appear\n",
    "implicitly i.e. 'it doesn't get loud' would be an implicity judgement on the speakers for this product. <br>\n",
    "##### Use of N-Grams\n",
    "I use \\[1-3\\]-grams due 3 being the maximum length of my aspect. In order to reduce extra aspects, I determine which smaller mined aspects are sub words of the longer ones e.i. remove 'phone' if 'cell phone' is already a mined aspect.\n",
    "##### Heuristic Distance From Adjective\n",
    "For all adjectives in the sentence there effect on the overall sentiment of the mined aspect is a function of its distance away. In this way it is possible to get different polarity scores for multiple mined aspects. One issue is that this is only a simple heuristic therefore isn't capturing the underlying sense of the words. An example where this would perform poorly is 'The phone is really terrible, battery life is however really amazing'. The battery life aspect is more effected by the terrible adjective than the amazing adjective based on distance. Additional issues stem from lack of negation checking for adjectives.\n",
    "##### VADER\n",
    "The VADER object I use is NLTK's implementation is a computational sentiment analysis engine, created from a gold standard human-curated sentiment lexicon. One benefit of using a lexicon such as this is that it doens't require training (Hutto and Gilbert, 2014). A weakness of this is that it is overly generalised and therefore doesn't evaluate the sentiment polarity of adjectives relating directly to you topic, i.e. it doesn't think that 'slow' is a negative description, when the aspect is a computer or phone this is obviously negative.

    "An alternative to the Apriori algorithm is to use Latent Dirichlet Allocation. Which is a generative models which aim to predict the propability distribution of words over a set number of topics. <br>\n",
    "One benefit of this approach is that LDA can assign a review to a topic without the most associated word occuring. In this way it is possible to generate implicit aspects within the reviews.\n",
    "Most commonly LDA is used on larger textset performing better on the document scale rather than the sentence scales (Pelgrim, 2022).<br>\n",
    "Also LDA is generally used for topic discovery rather than labeling, I break this method by assigning the most related word to each topic as the aspect to be assigned when a sentence is assigned this topic. A weakness of this is is that it isn't possible to get aspects which consist of more than 1 word and 1 aspect per sentence. In an ideal world instead of doing this I would hand label the criteria I thought the topics were covering, but inorder to make this process automated I decided to stick with this."

    "LDA aspect labeling accuracy is quite a bit larger for correct aspect labeling. I believe this is mostly because the LDA model has the opition of assigning general as a label if the probability of the topic with greatest assignment prob is less than 50% this means that since our dataset is comprised of majority non labeled (general) sentences. Analyzing the results below are 1.6 times more general aspects than all other labelled aspects combined."
